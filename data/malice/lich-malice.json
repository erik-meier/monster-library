While deceived, a creature perceives all allies and enemies as the lich, and perceives the environment as an unfamiliar wasteland corrupted by necrotic blight. If other creatures attempt to communicate with a deceived creature, that creature interprets their words as ghastly taunts in the lich's voice.\n\nThis effect lasts until an affected creature takes damage or an ally uses a main action to shake them out of it. Each time this feature is used during an encounter, the distance of the effect decreases by 5 squares (to a minimum of 5 squares) and the potency increases by 1."
