          "value": "<p>A host creature implanted by a soulraker hivequeen's Stinging Ovipositor has no physical or mental signs of the handmaiden gestating inside the host's body. After <span class=\"roll-formula\">1d3 + 1</span>{1d3+1 weeks of gestation}, the handmaiden fully forms inside the host. The handmaiden always moves with and occupies the same space as the host and can't be separated from them. While totally within the creature, the handmaiden doesn't have line of effect to the host or targets outside the host and vice versa. As a maneuver, the handmaiden can emerge from the host as a horrifying tower of flesh and bone that remains attached to the host's insides. While emerged, the handmaiden can use a move action to make the host move up to their speed and has access to the host's signature abilities, using the host's modifiers for any power rolls. The handmaiden has the same Stability as the host. If the handmaiden or host is force moved, the other moves with them. While emerged, the handmaiden can be targeted independently of the host. The handmaiden can retreat totally within the host's body as a maneuver. If the handmaiden dies, their remains separate from the host. The Find a Cure downtime project in Draw Steel: Heroes can be used to find a cure that removes a handmaiden from a host. The cure kills the handmaiden when consumed.</p>",
